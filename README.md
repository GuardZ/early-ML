# early-ML
A Python step-by-step primer for Machine Learning and Optimization

This `github` repository gathers `python` language training for Machine Learning and Optimization from basics of Python programming to Deep Learning.

## Objectives

Simple and step-by-step. One goal of `early-ML` is to show how to use some classical ML or data-related packages (such as `sklearn`) but also to have a deeper understanding of some ML algorithms where we use simple and plain Python to re-create our Machine Learning and Optimization routines.

## Organization

Depending on your Python level, best is to start to have a look at the organisation of the repository and pick the subject you are interested.
